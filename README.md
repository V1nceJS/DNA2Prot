# DNA2Prot
This project is a small python tool to convert DNA sequences to proteins, it's just a small side project for my biology class because we learnt about how DNA sequences get converted to mRNA and then proteins.

If I ever find time to work on this project again, I may add a graphic interfacee to input DNA sequences and get the amino acids output in a reable format.
